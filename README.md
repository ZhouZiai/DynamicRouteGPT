# DynamicRouteGPT
A Real-Time Multi-Vehicle Dynamic Navigation Framework Based on Large Language Models   used by SUMO
Research Contents: Proposed the framework of DynamicRouteGPT; combined global path optimization and local path
dynamic adjustment, and comprehensively considered real-time traffic information, driving preferences and emergencies, and
other factors to realize real-time dynamic path planning of multi-vehicles in real road network environment

Research Achievements: The framework could not only process real-time traffic information, but also dynamically adjust the
path planning to adapt to different traffic scenes and individual needs of drivers; the key innovation of this project was to make
counterfactual inference and optimize path decisions by creating causality diagram; the model did not need pre-training, had a
wide range of applications, and could handle many types of road networks; the experimental results showed that this approach
reached the most advanced level of current technology (SOTA) in the real-time dynamic path planning task of multi-vehicles
and had the ability to explain path selection; the approach could not only effectively choose the best path, but also explain the
reasons behind the choice, which provided a novel and efficient solution for dynamic navigation in complex traffic
environment.
